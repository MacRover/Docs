We will be utilizing ROS Kinetic on Ubuntu 16.04. 

The first step would be to install Ubuntu 16.04 on your machine. I would recommend Dual booting.

Here's a good video on the whole process:

NOTE:
**Please ensure that you download the correct version of Ubuntu, which would be 16.04.**

Once you have Ubuntu installed you can now install ROS Kinetic on your machine.

Here is a good resource for installing:
