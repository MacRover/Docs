* How to upload a bootloader to an STM32F103C8T6 Black Pill

For this you will need:
  - The black pill
  - An STLINK/V2 (the chinese knockoffs work fine)
    - NOTE: this can be done with other programmers/debuggers as well, but I will only be including instructions for how to upload with the STLINK/V2 here
  - A computer with:
    - The [[https://my.st.com/content/my_st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-programmers/stsw-link004.html][STLINK Utility]] installed
      - NOTE: if you don't want to make an account to download this software, [[http://bugmenot.com/view/st.com][BugMeNot]] can be used to find a premade junk account
    - The firmware you wish to upload
      - In this case I'll use the [[https://github.com/Serasidis/STM32_HID_Bootloader][hid\under{}generic\under{}pb12.bin]] firmware file. This is the one being used at the McMaster Mars Rover Team
